== Anti-if movement

____
Have you ever wondered how IFs impact on your code? Avoid dangerous IFs and use Objects to build a code that is flexible, changeable and easily testable, and will help avoid a lot of headaches and weekends spent debugging! Share how to write effective code the easy way!

The goal of the Anti-IF Campaign is to raise awareness of the effective use of software design principles and practices, by first of all removing bad, dangerous IFs.
