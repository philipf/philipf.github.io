Integration testing in a hybrid cloud architecture can be challeging when you have to test between on-premises resources and cloud workloads.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal[Azure's site-to-site VPN] make it possible to extend your on-premises network to private virtual networks on the cloud.

Normally, such a setup requires hardware that supports https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec[IPsec] VPN.
This can be problem if you don't have access to such an appliance or if you don't want the whole network to be affected by such a configuration.

This post describes how to use Libreswan as a software based IPSev VPN solution to connect to an Azure virtual gateway.

WARNING: Although this configuration works well for DevTest purposes it not recommended be used for production scenarios.

The latest source code can be found on https://github.com/philipf/azure-s2s-template[GitHub]

== The Solution Design
The design below shows the a base configuration that can be modified that connects an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) with an on-premises network.

In this configuration `oxtrot` can route traffic between `192.168.1.0/24` and `192.168.3.32/24`, thereby connecting resources such as `Alice` and `vm-echo` with each other.

image::/assets/azure-site-to-site-vpn/Azure-S2S-network.svg[Solution Design, align="center"]

The _Left_ side of network use standard Azure site-to-site components while the _Right_ side of the network uses https://libreswan.org/[Libreswan], a free open-source implementation of IPsec VPN.

== Pre-requisites
To build this configuration, you'll need the following:

- An active Azure subscription.
- Local network
- A Linux instance to run https://libreswan.org/:[Libreswan VPN software], preferably a dedicated VM. The installation script in this post was tested against Debian 10.05 and Ubuntu 20.04 (Compilation of Libreswan failed on Ubuntu 18.04).
- Modem/router to configure Firewall/NAT rules

== Quick Start
For the impatient, get going quickly by running the following steps, otherwise skip to <<Provision Azure Resources>>:

. Click the *Deploy to Azure* button to deploy the Azure S2S resources to your Azure subscription. 
The content of the ARM template can be https://github.com/philipf/azure-s2s-template/blob/master/template.json[viewed here].
+ 
{{<azdeploy "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philipf/azure-s2s-template/master/template.json">}} 

. Wait about *45 minutes* for the Azure Virtual Gateway to be provisioned. You'll need the pre-shared key (PSK) and the Virtual Gateway public IP (VGW VIP) from the previous step.

. *Install Libreswan* on `Ubuntu 20.04` or `Debian 10.05`, by running:
+  
[source, bash]
----
sudo sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philipf/azure-s2s-template/master/install-libreswan.sh)"
----
. Port forward *UDP 4500* and *UDP 500* from the public Internet to `Foxtrot` on your modem/router.
. *Test connectivity* by pinging `vm-echo` from `Foxtrot` and the visa versa

At this point you should have a connected site-to-site VPN.

== Provision Azure Resources
Start with following steps if you haven't performed the steps in the <<Quick Start>> section.

The Azure resources can be provisioned by either:

- Deploying the ARM template, the easier option.
- Or by running the PowerShell script, the more programmable option.

=== Using the ARM template
By far the easiest way is to deploy the https://github.com/philipf/azure-s2s-template/blob/master/template.json[ARM template] by clicking:
 
{{<azdeploy "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philipf/azure-s2s-template/master/template.json">}} 

or deploy it with the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-portal#deploy-resources-from-custom-template[Azure Portal],
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-cli#deploy-local-template[Azure CLI] 
or https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-powershell#deploy-local-template[Azure PowerShell].

=== Using PowerShell
*Update the configuration variables* in the the PowerShell script below and run it to provision the Azure site-to-site resources.
This can be run from either the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview[Azure Cloud Shell] or locally with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-4.6.1[Azure PowerShell]

----
<1> Supply your own significantly complex PSK, this key is used on both sides of the IPSec tunnel, and you'll will need it again as part of the Libreswan configuration.
<2> By convention thhis https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vpn-faq#do-i-need-a-gatewaysubnet[must be named] `GatewaySubnet`. :frowning:
<3> Adjust as per your network requirements, these networks should not overlap and should be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network[private IP addresses].
<4> Uses `icanhazip.com` to obtain your public address, otherwise supply your public IP address here.
<5> Uses the `Basic` SKU, it is the most afforable for testing purposes but has limitations and shouldn't be used in production.

NOTE: The provisioning of the Azure Virtual Gateway can take up to 45 minutes to complete, so this a good place to take a break and grab a :coffee:.
I advise against any :beer: at this point, as things can get tricky to troubleshoot if a simple mistake is made at this point.


=== Post deployment
A successfull deployment should result in the following resources being deployed:

image::/assets/azure-site-to-site-vpn/AzureResources.png[Azure Resources, align="left"]

Obtain the Virtual network gateway's public IP (VIP) by using one of the following methods:

[source, powershell]
.Azure Powershell
----
(Get-AzPublicIpAddress -Name 'pip-vgw-devtest' -ResourceGroupName 'rg-virtual-gateway').IpAddress
----

[source, bash]
.Azure CLI
----
az network public-ip show --name 'pip-vgw-devtest' -g 'rg-virtual-gateway' --query 'ipAddress' -o tsv
----

or look it up in the Azure Portal

image::/assets/azure-site-to-site-vpn/AzurePortalVgwVip.png[VGW VIP, align="left"]


== Firewall and NAT rules
Libreswan requires standard IPsecv2 ports to be open on your firewall. These ports are:

- UDP port 500 and
- UDP port 4500

This traffic has to be forwarded to the machine that runs Libreswan (`Foxtrot 192.168.1.2`)
On my Asus wireless router I had to configure my WAN port forwarding as follows:

image::/assets/azure-site-to-site-vpn/NAT.png[Router NAT rules]

It is not required by as an additional security measure I have also locked down the Source IP to the Azure Virtual Gateway's public IP (VIP).

== Install and configure Libreswan
Once the Azure Virtual Gateway deployment is complete, you can continue to install Libreswan on a Linux machine, preferably a clean dedicated virtual machine.

The installation script (`install-libreswah.sh`) downloads the source code, compiles, installs and configures version 3.32 of Libreswan.

====
For security reasons, support for DH2/modp1024 has been removed at compile time from Libreswan https://download.libreswan.org/CHANGES[since v3.30] (February 13, 2020).  

At the time of writing a Azure S2S VPN connections are created by default with an IPsec/IKE policy that uses DH2  :worried:.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-ipsecikepolicy-rm-powershell[Additional steps] can and should be taken to select a better IKE policy for production use.
Unfortunately the *Basic* SKU for VGWs do not support custom IPsec/IKE policies and only leaves us with the option to a use a VPN solution that still supports DH2, which in my case is acceptable for DevTest.

This script compiles the code with `USE_DH2=true` to enable DH2/modp1024.
Alternatively, one can upgrade to the next SKU (*VpnGw1*) that supports custom IPsec/IKE policies but it is https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/vpn-gateway/[more expensive], and I also wanted to keep the instruction as simple as possible, with the idea that once a successfull S2S connection has been established it can modified accordingly.
====

[source, bash]
.link:/assets/azure-site-to-site-vpn/azure-s2s-template/install-libreswan.sh[install-libreswan.sh, window="_blank"]
----
include::/src/static/assets/azure-site-to-site-vpn/azure-s2s-template/install-libreswan.sh[]
----

<1> This is the pre-shared key that was supplied when the Azure Virtual Gateway was created.
<2> Includes DH2 support at compile time.
<3> For Debian/Ubuntu there is no fipscheck library, and unbound is build without event api.

Libreswan uses the concept of 'left' and 'right' in its configuration files to distinguish between the two sides of the network, it doesn't which side is left or right.

At this point it should be possible to connect to resources located in the VNet, for example ping `vm-echo` from `Foxtrot`:
[source, bash]
.Ping vm-echo
----
philipf@foxtrot:~$ ping 192.168.3.36
PING 192.168.3.36 (192.168.3.36) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.3.36: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=35.7 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.3.36: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=35.7 ms
----

and also after connecting with SSH to `vm-echo` it possible to ping `Foxtrot`:
[source, bash]
.Ping Foxtrot
----
azureuser@vm-echo-dev:~$ ping 192.168.1.2
PING 192.168.1.2 (192.168.1.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=34.9 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=36.0 ms
----

=== IPsec troubleshooting
Hopefully you don't need to read this section :wink:, but if you are experiencing problems I found the following commands and configuration files useful to debug problems with the IPsec service.

[source, bash]
.View ipsec configuration files
----
# View the left/right and encryption settings:
cat /etc/ipsec.d/azure.conf

# View the PSK
cat /etc/ipsec.d/azure.secrets
----

[source, bash]
.Useful ipsec commands
----
# View the current ipsec status
sudo ipsec status

# Confirm that the ipsec connection is loaded and active
sudo ipsec status | grep "Total IPsec"
# It should return:
# 000 Total IPsec connections: loaded 1, active 1

# Control the ipsec service 
sudo ipsec stop
sudo ipsec start
sudo ipsec status

# View the active tunnels (if any)
sudo ipsec whack --trafficstatus
# It should return:
# 006 #7: "azureTunnel/1x1", type=ESP, add_time=1600483905, inBytes=3824, outBytes=2224, id='104.210.91.188'
----


== Routing
Additional routing is required to enable communication between VNet resources and other local devices. For example `Foxtrot` connecting to `Alice` and vice versa.

=== Configure Foxtrot for routing
`Foxtrot` has a connection to both the `192.168.1.0/24` and `192.168.3.0/24` network and therefore can be configured to route traffic between these two networks.
Update the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file with the setting below to enable IP forwarding and also to persist the setting when the VM restarts.

[source]
./etc/sysctl.conf
----
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
----

Apply the change by running:

[source, bash]
----
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
----

Also update `iptables` with the required masquerading rules.

[source, bash]
----
sudo modprobe iptable_nat
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
----

At this point it should be possible to connect *from* `192.168.3.0/24` to other devices on the `192.168.1.0/24` network in addition to `192.168.1.2`.
For example:

[source, bash]
----
azureuser@vm-echo-dev:~$ ping 192.168.1.1
PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=35.5 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=43.8 ms
----

It still not possible to route traffic *from* `Alice` and other `192.168.1.0/24` devices to the `192.168.3.0/24` network, but we will fix that next.

=== Configure Alice (or the Router) for routing

For this to work a routing rule is required, to achive this we need to update the routing table that `Alice` is using. This can be either configured on the default gateway's routing table that `Alice` is using or by using Alice's local routing table.
To keep it simple, we will update the local routing table on Alice.

Run these commands in PowerShell with *elevated priviliges (Admin)*.

First get the network interface index `InterfaceIndex` for the network adapter that is connecting `Alice` to the `192.168.1.0/24` network.

[source, powershell]
----
Get-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix 192.168.1.0/24 | Select-Object InterfaceIndex, InterfaceAlias

InterfaceIndex InterfaceAlias
-------------- --------------
            14 vEthernet (External (LAN)) <1>
----
<1> My `InterfaceIndex` is 14 and yours will most likely differ

Next create a new routing rule by using the `InterfaceIndex` from the previous step.

[source, powershell]
----
New-NetRoute `
  -DestinationPrefix 192.168.3.0/24 `
  -InterfaceIndex 14 ` 
  -NextHop 192.168.1.2
----

To confirm that the route has been added, run:

[source, powershell]
----
Get-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix 192.168.3.0/24

ifIndex DestinationPrefix NextHop     RouteMetric ifMetric PolicyStore
------- ----------------- -------     ----------- -------- -----------
14      192.168.3.0/24    192.168.1.2         256 25       ActiveStore
----

And then we should be set and ready to do a connectivity test by pinging `vm-echo` *from* `Alice`

[source, powershell]
----
PS C:\Users\philipf> ping 192.168.3.36

Pinging 192.168.3.36 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.3.36: bytes=32 time=37ms TTL=63
Reply from 192.168.3.36: bytes=32 time=37ms TTL=63
----

No further configuration is needed and hopefully you reached this point with a working configuration. :champagne: 

[TIP]
====
After testing, if you wish to do so you can clean up the custom routing rules from `Alice` by running:

[source, powershell]
----
Remove-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix 192.168.3.0/24
----
====

== Final thoughts

=== Alternative network topologies
To keep things relatively simple, the instructions in this guide deploys the VPN host (Foxtrot) to the `192.168.1.0/24` network, I prefer to isolate my personal DevTest/Lab network on `192.168.2.0/24` in order to have more flexibility when moving between different physical networks (eg. home and office networks).
If you prefer such a setup please refer to https://{{< ref "2020-08-29-lab-vm.adoc" >}}[Build an isolated network with Hyper-V for a virtual lab].
This will effectively mean that `foxtrot` will have an IP address in the `192.168.2.0/24` network such as `192.168.2.2`

=== Basic SKU
The Basic SKU is https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/vpn-gateway/[relatively afforable] at ~$26.28 US/month, but it has a couple of limitations to be aware of:

- Bandwidth is limited 100 Mbps
- Custom IPsec policies are not supported, as mentioned in this article.

Still, it useful for DevTest at this price range, as the next SKU is about 5 times the price at ~$138.70 US/month.
Keep in mind that you are charged for duration that the Virtual Network Gateway is provisioned even if you don't have any active connections.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/bandwidth/[Outbound data] charges after 5GB /month will also apply.

=== Security

* Misconfiguration of your network can leave you open for attack. Especially on the home network side where many manual steps are required and can result in accidental misconfiguration and lead to security issues.  
* Make sure to select your own strong PSK (at least 20 characters strong). 
* I also suggest the following when you are not actively using the S2S connection:
** Switch off your home VPN server
** Remove your NAT rules
** Switch of the S2S connnection on Azure
* If you have a dynamic public IP address at home, keep in mind that can it change and break the connection between Azure and your home. 

Keep in mind that only a PSK is required to connect either network once the S2S connection is broken.


=== IPsec policies
In case you prefer to upgrade to from the Basic SKU to utilise custom IPsec policies, I provided the following scripts and configuration snippets than can be applied over the existing deployments.
