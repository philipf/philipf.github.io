I'm mostly a **Java** guy. I'm still trying to acquire new skills.

I spent more than ten years on backends in various industries mostly as 
a consultant or a freelance contractor. Now I'm working at [Blablacar](blablacar.com).

I used some of my free time as a **mockito** core commiter, contributing random stuff on various open source projects.
Enjoying colaborative effort on opensource at some point I co-created the **Hackergarten Paris** with **Mathilde Lemée** 
and **Éric Lefevre**, now this event is the hands of **Florent Biville**. Of course I was attending Parisian _xxxx_ user groups and meetups.

Well that was before I was a father of two, now it gets physically more 
difficult ;)
